There won't be no next time!\nI apologize, even though I know it's lies\nI'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her\nTo the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—\n\n[Chorus: Rihanna]\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn?\nWell, that's all right because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry?\nWell, that's all right because I love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie\nI love the way you lie"
